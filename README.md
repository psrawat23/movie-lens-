The movies data set provides a solid foundation to Data Science learners for doing data analysis.


1.	Title: Merging csv files from movie lens dataset

Background information: The movies data set provides a solid foundation to Data Science learners for doing data analysis. This data file can be downloaded from the famous movie lens webpage (given in the link below). The three files are movies.csv, users.csv and ratings.csv. The users.csv contains information about the user’s gender, age and preference. The movies data set contains information about the movie name and genre. The ratings.csv file contains information on the ratings given by the users

Purpose of the case study: The purpose of this exercise is to understand how to do a meaningful merge twice – first, merge two data files and then merge the resulting file with a third data file

Problem description: Do a merge of all the three files movies.csv, users.csv and ratings.csv in an appropriate way as one csv file namely movies_integrated.csv by using a common column id present in each data file

Dataset:  https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Download and unzip your data files: Use the following files, movies.dat, users.dat and ratings.dat, copy the .dat files as .csv files

2.	Title:  Comparison of movie ratings given by Ladies and Gentlemen

Background information: The movies data set is downloaded in the previous case study. If you consider the ratings given for a product or food ordered in a restaurant or for movies the ratings vary depending upon the independent variables like gender, age and place. The ratings also vary for the same product in different stores or web sites. In this case study we consider the ratings given by users for movies and check if there are any rating differences

Purpose: The purpose of this exercise is to find out if there is any difference in movie ratings between gentlemen and ladies after looking through all the nearly 1 million ratings available in the dataset

Problem description: We have created the new merged movies_integrated.csv from the previous case study. Use that merged file to find if there is any difference in the way ladies and gentlemen rate the movies. If there is a difference in rating between genders, then show it in your data analysis and also through data visualization
